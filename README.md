# Klasroom 
- klassroom is web application where everyone can share their exam resources with one another. 
- klassroom helps to prepare well for exams.

``` 
The Idea behind creating this project is well most of the UG students prepare a day or couple 
of days before the exams and it is obivious with me also. so we actually share all the resources 
in the whatsapp where a person is limited with only the resource shared by his few friends this 
web application would store all the resources shared by many people at one place and they can 
also edit the resource or delete it permanently if it is unnecessary.

```
